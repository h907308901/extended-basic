Extended BASIC is a free and open-source programming language, developed from BASIC(Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code).

Extended BASIC is similiar to VB6, but they are not exactly the same, in some ways it seems to be more like C/C++, and has more features, but it is still as easy to learn and use as VB6.

The compiler's frontend is developed in VB6, and the backend uses [LLVM](http://llvm.org/).
